flag{this_was_an_easy_reverse}

in order to get the flag is enough to use the following command:
ltrace ./revmem asdasd

it can be done also with gdb, but pay attention: there is PIE!
Indeed, we need to put a breakpoint in the point of the execution in which the flag is saved in memory 
    -> we have to use brva (in this case, brva 0x122d)
We will see the flag saved in memory :D
