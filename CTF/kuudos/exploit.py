#solution: 15234-54312-32541-43125-21453

#the program checks if I inserted a right license, in particular checking if there are repetitions on rows, columns and diagonals.
#I have to bypass all the checks -> it is enough to use a 5x5 matrix that is valid for a sudoku challenge

# 15234
# 54312
# 32541
# 43125
# 21453

#is ok since this matrix doesn't have repetitions so it passes all the checks :)

#P.S. I noticed only after the sending of the flag that kuudos is the anagram of sudoku :')
