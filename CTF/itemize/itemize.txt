The goal is to call the method "construct()" of the class Item (page data.php), in order to get what is inside the file flag.txt

In order to do it, it is enough to upload, through the page upload_user.php, a serialized user that contains an item with $fid as "flag.txt"

I sent this: 
    O:4:"User":4:{s:4:"name";s:3:"edo";s:3:"fid";N;s:5:"items";a:1:{i:0;s:17:"../../../flag.txt";}s:2:"id";i:2;}

I will exploit the unserialization vulnerability.
This because page index.php prints out the Item, calling in this way the toString() method of the object, executing the instruction in the wanted field.
To retrieve the flag it is enough to use "../../../flag.txt" as command.
