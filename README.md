# Offensive and Defensive Cybersecurity course - Home and CTF challenges
This is a collection of all the challenges from the ODC course that I solved during the first semester of the A.Y. 2021/2022.

This repository is organized in different folders according to the topic of each challenge, including also the ones solved and delivered during the CTF final examination (10/01/2022).

Every subfolder corresponds to a challenge. A large part of them contain the executable file of the challenge, the python script used to get the flag and, sometimes, the .c file of the executable that was retrieved after the obtaining of the flag.
